# Menu-Driven Python Program for List Operations

This Python program is designed to perform various operations on a list of positive integers based on user input through a menu-driven interface.

## Operations Supported:
1. **Add an Integer to the List**
2. **Remove an Integer from the List**
3. **Display the List**
4. **Find the Maximum Integer**
5. **Find the Minimum Integer**
6. **Calculate the Sum of Integers**
7. **Calculate the Average of Integers**
8. **Exit the Program**

## How to Use:
1. **Add an Integer to the List**: Allows the user to enter a positive integer that will be added to the list.
2. **Remove an Integer from the List**: Prompts the user to enter an integer to remove from the list if it exists.
3. **Display the List**: Prints the current contents of the list.
4. **Find the Maximum Integer**: Displays the largest integer in the list.
5. **Find the Minimum Integer**: Displays the smallest integer in the list.
6. **Calculate the Sum of Integers**: Computes and prints the sum of all integers in the list.
7. **Calculate the Average of Integers**: Calculates and displays the average value of integers in the list.
8. **Exit the Program**: Terminates the program.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using `python menu_driven_list_operations.py`.
